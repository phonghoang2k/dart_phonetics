The theory of the algorithms included in this package have been published in several forms.
As such, several variations of the algorithms have been implemented by several open source
projects. The algorithms contained here were researched, designed, implemented, tested, and
then optimized specifically for Dart.

See the source code or documentation for additional references about the origin of each algorithm.

Apache Commons Codec

The Java implementations of the phonetic coding algorithms in the 'language' package were reviewed
for reference. Many of the algorithms are too dependent on ASCII (where Dart supports UTF-16) and
do not use strategies that are optimal for a language like Dart. However, the test cases are useful
for verifying the phonetic encodings are correct.

ABYDOS

The Python implementations of the phonetic coding algorithms in the 'phonetic' package were reviewed
for reference. The implementations are very Python oriented, Strings are UTF-8 by default, and
do not use strategies that are optimal for a language like Dart. However, the test cases are useful
for verifying the phonetic encodings are correct.

Aspell - Test Data

Some of the tests in this package use data from, Apache Commons Codec, which in turn derived some
test data from the Aspell source code.

Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching (BMPM)

The original reference implementation for this algorithm is in PHP source code and made available
via the link listed below. Several other versions of this algorithm have been implemented and
published as part of other open source works (e.g., Apache Commons Code, ABYDOS, Solr/Lucene).
