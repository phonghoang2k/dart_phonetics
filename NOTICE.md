## Preface

The logic and theory of the algorithms included in this package have been 
shared in many publications. As such, many variations of these algorithms have 
been implemented by several open source projects.

The implementations contained in this package are an original creation because 
each was researched, designed, implemented, tested, and then optimized
specifically for Dart.

## Reference Notices

The following notices are intended to provide attribution to some of the more 
popular phonetic encoding implementations from other programming languages. 
The test cases from such projects is particularly useful.

### [Aspell](http://aspell.net) - Test Data

Some of the tests in this package were derived from analyzing tests from 
Apache Commons Codec which in turn derived some test data from the Aspell 
source code.

### [Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching](http://stevemorse.org/phoneticinfo.htm) (BMPM)

The original reference implementation for this algorithm is in **PHP** source 
code and made available via the link listed below. Other versions of this 
algorithm are included in the aforementioned projects (and several others).
